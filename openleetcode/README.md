# ⚡ Modern Modular Next.js Web Interface

This is a **Next.js 14** project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), designed with a **modular architecture** for scalability, speed, and flexibility.

> 🧩 Every feature lives in its own **module** under `src/modules`  
> ⚡ Powered by: Next.js (App Router) + TRPC + Redis + PostgreSQL  
> 🌐 Optimized for modern web interfaces with prefetching and SSR

## 🧠 Project Philosophy

We follow a **modular-by-feature** structure. Each feature is a standalone module under:

```
src/
├── modules/
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   └── image-processing/
```

* 💡 **Isolated & Reusable**: Each module contains its own components, API logic, types, and utilities.
* 🧵 **TRPC Prefetching**: Enables smoother UX and reduced load time.
* ⚡ **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
* 🐘 **PostgreSQL**: Robust and scalable relational database.
* 🎯 **No Git Required**: You don’t have to use Git to contribute — we handle that.
